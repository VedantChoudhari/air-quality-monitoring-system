# `Air Quality` (HVAC) Monitoring Web App

<!-- <hr> -->

This repository contains the website created to display the content of <u>real-time</u> HVAC <i>(Heat, ventilation, and air conditioning)</i> data monitoring.

## Description
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This project was developed as part of the `(BCSE313L) Fog and Edge Computing` course at VIT-Chennai.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The website serves as a responsive dashboard, offering visual representations of both historical and real-time data collected from various sensors and hardware components.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As a pre-requisite for the project in the subject, this project adheres to the C2F2T (Cloud-to-Fog-to-Things and its reverse) model, as explained in the subsequent section.

## Project Overview

   * **`Data Collection:`**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Data is collected by using various sensors such as MQ-series sensors, DHT-11, and flame sensors.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        An Arduino periodically reads the data from these sensors.

   *  **`Data Passage:`**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Data collected from the sensors by Arduino is passed to the Raspberry-Pi using serial communication at appropriate baud-rate.  

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

   * **`Data Filtering and Display:`**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The Raspberry Pi splits, filters, and processes the received data locally.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Weather predictions are fetched using an API for the day and night at the specified location.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Based on the latest locally received data and online predictions, display graphics are generated and updated on an the LCD-TFT display.

       <img src="./public_images/runtime_display_pic.png" alt="Hierarchy of C2F2T and latency" width="250px"/>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Further, the data is passed to the cloud for storage and further access.

   * **`Data Storage:`**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Firebase, a NoSQL database, is utilized to create, retrieve, and update data.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The data received in this series is stored under specific firebase nodes.

   * **`Web Interface:`**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        A fully functional and responsive website is created and deployed on vercel.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The website fetches data from the cloud, and its components are updated periodically.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The website also features an Emergency Alert System, which can be a lifesaver in cases of fire or gas leakage in the monitored area.

   * **`Hardware Setup:`**

## C2F2T Architecture
   
   1. Cloud-to-Things:  
      - This aspect involves the flow of data and services from the cloud to the edge devices or "things" (such as sensors, actuators, or IoT devices).
      
   1. Things-to-Cloud:  
      - In contrast to C2T, T2C refers to the flow of data and services from the edge devices or "things" to the cloud.  
      
   1. Bidirectional Communication:  
      - The C2F2T model emphasizes bidirectional communication between the cloud and edge devices, enabling seamless interaction and data exchange in both directions.   
      - This approach benefits from various hardware computing power at different nodes in the IoT ecosystem.  
      - Bidirectional communication enables real-time monitoring, control, and decision-making capabilities at the edge while leveraging the extensive computational and storage capabilities of the cloud.

      1) **Things**:  
         - All sensors act as things. 
         - Things collect the data on ground level.  
      2) **Edge**:  
         - The edge device is an Arduino, which has limited computing power and basic computer functionalities.
         - It collects and temporarily stores the data within its limited small storage capabilities.  
      3) **Fog**:  
         - A Raspberry Pi is the middle device in the project. It gets data from the edge level, filters, and processes it with its relatively large compute power.
         - The RasPi thus acts as the fog layer.  
      4) **Cloud**:  
         - Finally, data is collected in the cloud.  
         - This data is then used to serve the website.  
         - The cloud can also be utilized to run predictive models and gain meaningful insights from the data.
         - Thus, leverages the power of machine learning and the resource-intensive nature of cloud infrastructure.
